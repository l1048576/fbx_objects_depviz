== About
This is utility to visualize dependency of FBX objects.

"Normal" users of FBX won't need this utility, but it may be useful for implementers of FBX loader library.

== Usage
[source]
----
cargo run -- <fbx_file> [--output=<dot_file>] [--filter=<json_file>]
----

This utility loads `fbx_file` and modify styles or visibility of nodes (if `json_file` is specified),
and then puts dot file to `dot_file`.
If `dot_file` is not specified, standard output is used.

About dot files, see link:http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz | Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software] and
link:http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language[This official document].

For sample json files and their outputs, see `examples/` directory.
